I have a suspicion that in his 3rd year he will remove/alter the rules around being born a citizen so that EM can run for president. I think he will do this because I think EM likely interfered in the 2024 election and is blackmailing him with it.

Now they will. But the next election is still 4 years away; a LOT can change between now and then. If Trump’s popularity continues to fall his endorsement isn’t going to be enough to win 2028. His base certainly wasn’t enough for him to win in 2024; he needed median voters, too.
