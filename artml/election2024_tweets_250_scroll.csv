At least 10 million phantom votes in 2020 that did not show up in 2024.  There were 20 million on election night 2024 but the people caught on and the machine had to inject them after the election to cover for the previous fraud since too many people saw it.  Investigate 2024.

Look at the state of their MPs as well, Seymour was meticulous at one thing & that was keeping them out of sight & silent before the election
Now the country is paying for it - you have to wonder how National bank-benchers feel about being overlooked in favour of that based on 8%

FAFO, 2/10/25 edition:

Trump froze all USDA direct payments to farmers.

Turns out these folks who want to strangle government actually rely on it for a material part of their income.

Farmers and rural residents were one of his most reliable voting blocs in 2024 election.

On 14 January 2025,  Dame Angela Eagle MP, minister for border security and asylum, said  that since the general election (4 July 2024) the number of hotels being  used had increased by six. So, I don't know where you get that 50% figure from. Laughable.

It doesn’t, the people who voted for Trump in 2016 voted for him in 2020 too, and then some more, unlike what happened to the Democrats in 2024 losing a ton of voters, Trump gained voters every election because his supporters actually like him lol

Yes, that was a huge lie by the Biden administration. 

Funds were diverted from almost every part of the federal government to maximize the number of illegals in America. 

There also appear to be significant funds siphoned from Social Security to pay for illegals.
